An app to locate your buddy using augmented reality

## Objective
Use a client-server model, in which the client uses a REST API constantly (while open) to receive information about requested "buddies" (contacts in your phone)  

Each phone is uniquely identified by its phone number  

Buddies are represented in AR by a "beacon of light"
